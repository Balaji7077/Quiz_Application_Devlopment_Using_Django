## QUIZ APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT


I have developed a Django quiz application for creating and administering quizzes. This quiz app is a versatile web application designed to revolutionize learning and assessment and transform traditional learning and testing methods. This application has used Django and Python for fetching data from the back-end to the front-end, HTML, and CSS for designing the webpage, and SQL for storing the data in the databases.

The app allows users to:
#### i)Answer Questions: 
The app presents users with a list of questions within the selected category. Users can select answers to these questions.

#### ii)Check Correctness: 
Upon selecting an answer, the app checks if itâ€™s correct and provides the total obtained marks after submission.
